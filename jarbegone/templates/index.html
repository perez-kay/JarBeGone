          Are you tired of reading academic paper after paper, struggling
          to understand the language used? Do you find these papers to be too long,
          or full of jargon that you simply can't understand? Then JarBeGone is the
          tool for you!</p>

          <!-- Simply upload a PDF of your favorite (or least favorite)
          academic paper, select the sections you want to include and the length of
          your generated summary, and watch as JarBeGone creates an interactive
          summary to help you with your studies -->
